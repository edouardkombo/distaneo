## About Distaneo

This Laravel based project has been created upon a challenge.
The challenge is to geolocate affiliates at 100km range from specific GPS coordinates.
The list of affiliates is given as a "txt" file, located in "/public/affiliates.txt".

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Requirements

- Write a program that will read the full list of affiliates from this txt file and output the name and IDs of matching affiliates within 100km, sorted by Affiliate ID (ascending).
- You can use the first formula from this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) to calculate distance. Don't forget, you'll need to convert degrees to radians.
- The GPS coordinates to locate from are 53.3340285, -6.2535495.
- Code should be production ready, clean and tested!
- Demonstrate understanding of MVC
- Unit Tests
- Basic HTML output
- Usage of a PHP Framework (We're a Laravel based company so bonus points for using that)
- Use the original txt file as input
